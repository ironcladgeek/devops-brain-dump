# 🧠 DevOps Brain Dump

Welcome to my personal collection of DevOps/MLOps knowledge, scripts, and random useful stuff I don't want to forget! This repo serves as my digital garden of various solutions, snippets, and notes I've gathered throughout my MLOps engineering journey.

## 🤔 What's This?

This is essentially my public notebook where I store:
- 🐍 Python scripts that make my life easier
- 🔧 MLOps utilities and helper functions
- 📝 Notes on various tools and technologies
- 🚀 Deployment configurations and templates
- 💡 Solutions to problems I've encountered (and will probably encounter again)
- 🎓 Learning resources and references

## 🌟 Key Features

- **No Strict Organization**: This is a brain dump, after all! But I try to keep things somewhat findable.
- **Practical Focus**: Real-world solutions over theory
- **Living Document**: Continuously updated as I learn and discover new things
- **Community Friendly**: Feel free to use anything you find useful!
